The concurrency and locks depends on the data structure used in the database 
1) HashTable Database - if its a hash table data then the lock can be applied on a  certain record, this ensures higher concurrency 
  as we can lock individual records and the requests on other record which are not locked can still be processed, but the downside is
  that there will be locks on records and the maintainenance of locks can be an issue. 

2) B+ tree based databases - in B + tree based database we have pages which will be locked and these pages may have multiple records
  and all these records will be locked when a page is accessed, this reduces the concurrency but the upside is that we will have less 
  locks to maintain than in the hash table database.
